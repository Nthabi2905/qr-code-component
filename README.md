### What I learned

While working on this QR code component project, I reinforced my understanding of several key web development concepts:

**CSS Flexbox for centering:**
I learned how to properly use Flexbox to center content both vertically and horizontally on the page, which was essential for this card component.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```
